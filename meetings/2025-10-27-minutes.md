Florian: We should be making friends and asking for reviews from subject matter experts...

## Authentication Next Steps
* overview page is live: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Authentication

ðŸŽ‰

Will: This is an overview page and it lists different guides but the guides don't exists yet. Main work will be 4 sepate guide on 4 authentication mechanisms... Passwords, OTP, Fed ID, Passkeys - also will talk about MFA and session management.

* the **password** authentication PR: https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/41594
  * Martina has given some good feedback
  * Simone to find someone in w3c community to give some additional review

*we discuss Martina's [comment](https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/41594#discussion_r2456588348) - are passkeys phishing resistent?*

Simone: There have been blog posts talking about instances where passkeys are phishing succeptable.

Will: One of the main reasons for using it is that they are phishing resistent...

Simone: ..."monkey patch" credentials... If you have installed an extension...

Will: I do remember that attack - but the attack is "if you install malicious software then it can subvert your auth" .. so yeah.

Simone: this is the from DEFCON... Also similar to the question we have on digital credentials API... some govts want to protech against "malicious wallet"... [which would not give user freedom ... would like to not force people to use specific wallet...]

Simone: *https://labs.sqrx.com/passkeys-pwned-0dbddb7ade1a*

Dan: maybe the wording should be "mitigate" instead of "protect"?

Will: I prefer not vague language... I want to be able to resolve doubt.  I don't want to say "signfigantly reducing the risk" - or "depeneds on the authenticator"... We need helpful, practical advice for developers.  I think in the passkeys doc it does make sense to talk about different attacks against passkeys, but in this doc (which is about passwords).

Dan: Makes sense to me. 

Will: i feel it's an assumption you should have, when we're talking about phishing, that the systems are working as intended. That's the thing with phishing that it works with everything still working fine. So if the attack only works if you subvert a piece of the system, then it's a different kind of attack. We don't know where these attacks are going to show up. But the classic phishing attack with password will not happen with passkeys [assuming all the components are working correctly and not subverted].

Simon: yes - that's a more clear communication - and if we think phishing is the kind of attack, passkeys can fix this...

* the **federated** identity outline: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1miZbXVjs070J2HH0rsDxqPnUaqNtPP51Uo8d4FU6PTk/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.odg3u0f7hmsm

Will: added a section... an out line for what I'm planning to do...

*we go through Will's outline*

Simone: *feel free to take pieces from here https://www.w3.org/reports/identity-web-impact/#federated-identity-model*

Florian: https://infosec.mozilla.org/guidelines/iam/openid_connect.html

Will: ... not wanting to do full page re-directs.. need iFrame so need 3rd party cookies... FedCM means you don't need 3p cookies. With fedcm the browser takes care of it for you. 

Dan: who's supporting FedCM right now?

Will: only Chromium but it has cross-browser support I believe. Would like to know what the commitments are from Safari and Firefox.

Will: IDPs... Google have their own implementaiton... 

Will: Want to talk about Pros & Cons - one Con is that you're locking a user into one other provider unless you support multiple providers...

Dan: echos some discussions we've had in the TAG... 

*discussion of how some browsers support heuristcs for popular auth flows even if they otherwise have deprecated 3p cookies*

* **OTP** outline https://docs.google.com/document/d/1miZbXVjs070J2HH0rsDxqPnUaqNtPP51Uo8d4FU6PTk/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.m3asiob2y121

Will: OTP is simpler... 

Florian: I've started writing about OTP today - the article will talk about email, SMS and authenticator apps... and discusses that.  I'm quite lucky it's not as complex as federated...

Dan: when you talk about SMS make sure you point out that SMS has some security issues...

Simone: some definitions from my identity report: https://www.w3.org/reports/identity-web-impact/#federated-identity-model
