# SWAG Minutes - Mon 29 September 2025

Present: Dan, Florian, Will, Giovanni

## Plans for survey

From Simone: [paraphrased] We won't ask for e-mail but we will ask them to join the community group if they would like to be interviewed...

So what is the next step?

*we debate whether this will be too much friction*

Will: alternative - people could respond on social media.

*we agree to share the survey - and ask people to join the CG if they want to participate in further discussions*

*Dan to work on text.*

## PR 29 Merged

https://github.com/w3c-cg/swag/pull/29

Dan: I committed Will's feedback....

## Merge PR 31?

https://github.com/w3c-cg/swag/pull/31

Floran : wrote an article about SSRF 

Dan: *leaves positive review*

*we agree good to merge*

## Discussion on Passkeys?

Will: next thing I want to work on is - authentication - see below - happy to get feedback. I had feedback from Martina - we should really talk about Passkeys - as they are a thing that uses web authentication. She also gave more detail and useful info that I will incorporate into the outline. So updated the outline.

Dan: Anything for our own guidelines?

Will: It might be good to use guidelines around authenticaiton... its own section? 

Dan: feels like it should be in security_guidelines.md - as a separate section.

Florian: there's a new CG on credentials and authentication adopton.. Maybe nice to work together. https://www.w3.org/community/wica/

Simone: this group was an idea from webauthn wg... to promote the adoption of web authentication... a web layer for passkeys. The main problem is the developer needs to choose  to use it... I have a list of different authenticaiton types - we can use that. We could also talk with Tim C. directly.

Dan: I suggest we write something ... and then reach out for comment...

Florian: we are working on MDN.. they are working on microsties - we can still share experience.

Will: *will file a SWAG issue* I agree having another top level section in security_guidelines... is the right approach. 

## Concrete Attacks 

From Florian :"What are concrete attacks you expect to be documented for MDN readers? (web developers, library developers, etc.)
The attacks we already have are listed here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks.
Work in progress articles which we will have soon are: Supply chain attacks, Phishing, IDOR."

New content in review, feedback appreciated:
- Supply chain attack article: https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/41034
- IDOR attack: https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/41200
- JavaScript Prototype Pollution: https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/41260
  - Thanks for the great feedback so far! Will try to work it in the next few days
- Thinking about writing about DOM Clobbering as well
- More?

Florian: we're writing documentation for concrete attacks... some are still in review... Supply chain attacks is an open PR... Working on prototype pollution... Lots of feedback...   One more in review - indirect object reference... 

*discussion on graphql and we agree not to write on this at this time*

Florian: another topic - DOM clobbering attacks... Nice article from Frederick... Might quality for an MDN article as well... Coming to an end with this work...  Soon going to switch to authenticaiton.

## Supply chain attacks

https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/41034 - merge?

Dan: let me ask for some additional review... from the OpenSSF community.

*we agree to give Dan a day before merging*

Simone: [on threat modelling] - one of the discussions with the digital credentials API - they were complaining that I listed threats with them ... one proposal was move to a separate doc "threat model for the web"... I will reference the threats that you already have documented.

... we should also talk about "the human web" the threats going to be exploited regarding the human, not only the technical things... 

Dan: examples?

Simone: e.g. https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/tim-berners-lee/this-is-for-everyone/9781035023677 - privacy covers covers many but there are some threats missing... e.g. attention hijacking on social networks ... deceptive patterns ... trying to publish a summary of these threat models somewhere.  3 models ... one is technical - e.g. autoplay, infinite scrolling,... there are some technical remediation... also C2PA could be a potential remediation... Article 25 in EU could be a policy remediation... 

Florian: we touched on this a bit - when we wrote about Phishing attacks - also a glossary entry on social engineering... https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Social_engineering

Simone: https://www.nirandfar.com/how-to-manufacture-desire/ ... as an example ...
