# SWAG Minutes - Mon 11 August 2025

Present: Dan, Giovanni, William, Simone

## Survey

Will: got feedback from MDN on surveys... 2 guidelines - one is collecting info from people - is it OK to ask for peoples' email addresses... other thing is survey length (3-5 questions). For the email address thing I've ask for clarification... Other question on length... I didn't get an answer... Might be better to use MDN as a funnel... One question survey...

Simone: from a gdpr perspective... the agreement is often between the user and the web site that is exposing the question... if it's MDN then Mozilla is the party... There should also be an agreement between them and W3C... 

Dan: ... injects uncertainty and angst...

Simone: we can try to make it simple ... but we can sat "email address.. but we only will use it to contact you... and nothing else.... We're using the data only for that reason." 

Will: that sounds reasonable... In practice we would have MDN mozilla ... someone responsible at Mozilla has to agree that this is an appropriate course to take.

Simone: I can also ask legal at W3C... 

Dan: maybe MDN would help us run the survey... even if it's not their survey.

Will: a "banner" - that's what we're asking them to do... It's something I can follow up with...

Will: in background, working on supply chain attacks...
