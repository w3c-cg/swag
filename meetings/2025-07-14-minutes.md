# SWAG Minutes - Mon 14 July 2025

Present: Simone, Dan, Aaron

## Regulatory document

https://github.com/w3c-cg/swag/blob/main/docs/regulatory_policy.md - 

From Dan's problem motivation slides: Boundaries between web application and more native applications (i.e. mobile) and apps that cause real-world effects (i.e. smart home) are very blurred-- and hence the security standards need to be higher. For instance-- use libraries that have been vetted.

Dan is looking for feedback on the draft doc. Do not need to be lawyer because we are explicitly not giving legal advice.

## Survey

Going through each of the survey comments. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K2ofj5JgCDgIg5-xZTFMwYXms7KXoiid-e0QucUeGyc/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0#heading=h.b8o6rwyukyw7

Do we want to keep descriptions around what each of the mitigations we ask about? Or just name them and ask?
