## Paskeys & Generally Getting Expert Feedback

*reviewing https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/42338*

Will: Should we gate on expert review ... ? 

Dan: Good opportunity to engage with apple...?

Florian: has emailed someone from Apple... but not on Passkeys... I can send another one saying we have a Pull Request... on Passkeys.

Florian: we need to "activate" these subject matter experts more to do these subject reviews of PRs... We need to get better at this next year. Also relevant for Docs CG.

Dan: We should go there, it seems, because they are not coming here.

Will: sometimes we have more aggressive timescales... 

Dan: we could have a number of options... (1) asking them to come here (2) going to their spaces... like a slack or a mailing list or a github  (3) getting on their agenda... 

Florian: we also have to find out what the prefered places of these groups are.

*Discussed pinging Microsoft, Igalia people directly*

Will: Also passkeys.dev .. seems to be mostly Tim Capaldi's thing..  Passkeys.dev needs work.. We should be working together to make the world better.
