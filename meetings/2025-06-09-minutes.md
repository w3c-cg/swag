# SWAG Minutes - Mon 9 June 2025

Present: Dan, Will, Aaron

## Dan's talks 

Talking at OpenSSF Community Days NA in Denver in June and Europe in Amsterdam in August... What should be the calls to action?

Will: we don't want security professionals to answer the survey - we want web developers... so not sure that's the call to action...  

## Survey

draft: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K2ofj5JgCDgIg5-xZTFMwYXms7KXoiid-e0QucUeGyc/edit?tab=t.0

Good feedback so far... added a bunch of stuff.. looks somewhat massive... We need more feedback from group members.....  Let's put it on the Slack.

Aaron: working on a google blog post on external work including work of this group - so can include the call to action on the survey there... 

## Regulatory Policy Doc

https://github.com/w3c-cg/swag/pull/25

Dan: I will make another pass at this and then send review requests to all...

## Guidelines...

Will: been thinking about MDN docs and MDN security docs... started a proposal for reorg of MDN security documentation... no feedback so far ... except from Hamish... https://github.com/orgs/mdn/discussions/802 Written a bunch of pages on different attacks... a lot of defenses work across multiple attacks... e.g. same site cookies are a response to CSRF and clickjacking...
